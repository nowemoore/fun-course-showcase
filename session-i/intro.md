## What to Expect

There will be games, examples, hands-on tasks, **and yet it'll to be rough**. Not because the content is difficult, but because programming is a **whole new mindset**. It will push you to view the world in a way you've potentially never experienced before. And that's no easy ask. Bundle up!
