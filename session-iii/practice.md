## 💪 Instructions

1) Go to [kaggle.com](kaggle.com) and pick a dataset you like. (You may be required to create an account.)
2) Load your selected CSV file into a dataframe using `pandas`.
3) Modify your file. Here are some ideas:
    - create a new column with modified data from a different column
    - sort your table by data in a selected column
    - calculate the average (mean) value for a numeric column
    - filter the table to show only rows where values in a column equal a specific value
    - count how many unique groups exist in a categorical column
    - retrieve the value of a specific cell using its row and column index

4) Save your new file.
5) Use `plotly` to graph some.
