# Welcome to the Final Session!

You made it all the way through today, well done!

## Reflection

Here are some questions to reflect on:

1) What are three words I would use to describe how I feel about programming as a whole and why?
2) How did my view of programming change after today? 
3) What is my unique definition of programming?
4) Could I build something useful using Python with the skills I have? If so, what are some concrete next steps I could take? If not, what do I yet have to learn?
